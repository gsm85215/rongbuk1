@par Example Description

  This example provides a description of how to configure LTDC peripheral to 
  display an RGB image of size 480x272 and format RGB565 (16 bits/pixel) on LCD using only one layer.
  In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the LTDC 
  structure. 

  In this example, the code is executed from QSPI external memory while data are in internal
  SRAM memory.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to set the Flash latency and  to configure the system clock :
  - The Cortex-M7 at 400MHz 
  - The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI/AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
  - The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1/APB2 peripherals 
    and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to run at 100MHz.

  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 is configured to display image 
  (modelled by an array) loaded directly from flash memory by LTDC integrated DMA.

  Each LCD device has its specific synchronous timings values.
  This example use :
  The TFT LCD 4.3 inch RK043FN48H-CT672B 480x272 :  LCD mount on the DISCO board
   In this case the synchronous timings are as following :
      Horizontal Synchronization (Hsync) = 41
      Horizontal Back Porch (HBP)        = 13
      Active Width                       = 480
      Horizontal Front Porch (HFP)       = 32

      Vertical Synchronization (Vsync)   = 10
      Vertical Back Porch (VBP)          = 2
      Active Height                       = 272
      Vertical Front Porch (VFP)         = 2
  
  LCD_TFT windowing configuration :
  ---------------------------------

  To configure the active display window, this example configures the 
  horizontal/vertical start and stop. 

  HorizontalStart = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP);
  HorizontalStop  = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP + Window_Width - 1); 
  VarticalStart   = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP);
  VerticalStop    = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP + Window_Heigh - 1);
  
  Window_width and Window_heigh should be in line with the image size to be 
  displayed.

STM32H750B-DISCO board's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED2 is ON when there is an error in Init process.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note For the Cortex-M7, If the  application is using the DTCM/ITCM memories (@0x20000000/ 0x0000000: not cacheable and only accessible
      by the Cortex-M7 and the  MDMA), no need for cache maintenance when the Cortex M7 and the MDMA access these RAMs.
      If the application needs to use DMA(or other masters) based access or requires more RAM, then  the user has to:
              - Use a non TCM SRAM. (example : D1 AXI-SRAM @ 0x24000000)
              - Add a cache maintenance mechanism to ensure the cache coherence between CPU and other masters(DMAs,DMA2D,LTDC,MDMA).
              - The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
                must be	properly defined to be aligned to L1-CACHE line size (32 bytes). 
 
@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence.
      Depending on the use case it is also possible to configure the cache attributes using the MPU.
      Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
      Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32H750xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32H750B-DISCO board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

     The default configuration is the right one: 
     - DATA_AREA set to USE_INTERNAL_SRAM
     - CODE_AREA set to USE_QSPI
  2. Program the internal Flash with the ExtMem_Boot (see below).
  3. Program the external memory with this example(see below).
  4. Start debugging the example or reset for free running.

In order to load the ExtMem_Boot code :
   - Open your preferred toolchain :
      - Open the Project
      - Rebuild all files
      - Load project image

In order to load this example to the external memory:
   - Open your preferred toolchain
      - Open the Project
      - Use project matching ExtMem_Boot selected configuration
      - Rebuild all files:
      - Run & debug the program :
      - For an XiP configuration (eXecute in Place from QSPI):
          - Using EWARM or MDK-ARM : Load project image from the IDE: Project->Debug
          - Using STM32CubeIDE  :
            - Open the STM32CubeProgrammer tool
            - Select the QSPI external flash loader "MT25TL01G_STM32H750B-DISCO" in case of XiP from QSPI
            - From Erasing & Programming menu, browse and open the output binary file relative to your example
            - Load the file into the external QSPI flash using "Start Programming" at the address APPLICATION_ADDRESS (0x90000000)
